        If you have any questions about your rights and obligations under this Agreement, please contact legal counsel
        in your jurisdiction. Before registering, you must understand the laws of your jurisdiction. Casino Speed disclaims any liability to you in relation to any compliance issues. </p>

      <h4 class="mt-3"> PURPOSE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS </h4>
      <p> The General Terms and Conditions regulate the legal relationship between Casino Speed and a
        player. </p>

      <h4 class="mt-3"> DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION </h4>
      <p> In this Agreement, the following terms and phrases have the meanings described herein unless the context
        suggests otherwise and they govern the Player's use of the Website. </p>
      <p> Agreement refers to the Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cancellation Policy, Advertising Terms and
        Conditions and House Rules. </p>
      <p> Devices include all application devices, including but not limited to personal computers, laptops, cell
        phones, smartphones, tablets, other mobile devices and personal digital assistants. </p>


      <h4 class="mt-3"> ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS </h4>
      <p>Casino Speed also reserves the right to change any or all of the terms and conditions of a
        promotion. If the Terms and Conditions undergo any material changes, the player will be notified prior to the
        change. Upon such notification, the Player must be provided with the new Terms and Conditions before being
        granted access to our Services again. </p>
      <p> Your continued use, access and participation in the Services through the Site or a Device following such
        notice constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. </p>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and may not be
        modified except as expressly provided for in Section 4.1 above. For the avoidance of doubt, this expressly
        excludes any change or modification to these Terms and Conditions made verbally, via chat, SMS, email or
        similarly, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by our individual customer support representative or other
        gaming instruction representative. </p>

        currency for deposits or withdrawals, and ID numbers. </p>
      <p> The player must ensure that all information submitted to Casino Speed is accurate and current. </p>
      <p> Your username must not be obscene, threatening, racist, abusive, derogatory, defamatory, or infringing the
        intellectual property or proprietary rights of any third party. If your username is deemed inappropriate at
        Casino Speed' discretion, customer support will request that you change it. If you do not comply with
        this request, Casino Speed reserves the right to terminate your player account. </p>

      <p> Casino Speed reserves the right to request proof of age and identity from the participant at any
        time in order to prevent minors from accessing the website. Each participant registering on the website must
        provide a valid ID, address, email address and contact telephone number. </p>
      <p> By creating an account and agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you authorize us to verify and confirm your
        identity and age. </p>
      <p> We carry out regular checks to verify players' identities and ensure that they are of legal age for the social
        casino. </p>

        successfully verify your age within seventy-two hours of your first deposit, we reserve the right to suspend
        your account until verification is completed. </p>

        related to your participation. In addition, we may use your personal information to inform you about changes,
